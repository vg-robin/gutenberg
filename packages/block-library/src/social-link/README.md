# Social Icon block

The Social Icon is a foundational block that displays various icons linking to different social profiles or sites. Each social service is registered as a variation of this block.


## Adding new social icons

The core maintains certain standards for adding new social icons. To add a new variation to WordPress, it must be well-established and popular.

To evaluate if a social service should be added, contributors will consider the following factors:

* Is the service popular enough for core developers to have heard of it before? Is it "mainstream?"
* How long has the service been online?
* Does it have a Wikipedia article?
* Is there a plugin adding social icons in the repository that includes the services in question and has a considerable number of active installations?
* Is this social service frequently requested?
